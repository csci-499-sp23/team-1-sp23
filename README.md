## What is SchoolsDB?

SchoolsDB is a web application that aggregates data about high schools in New York City from NYC Open Data and allows its users to have access to important information about NYC high schools like the graduation rate, attendance rate, academic opportunities like AP courses offered by the school and foreign language courses, directions to the school, and clubs and extracurricular activities offered by the school. Users can also sign up to be current students, parents, teachers or alumni who can leave reviews or comments about the school.

Our application operates in a similar fashion to Google Maps. Markers are placed on a map where users could click on them to get more information about the school. Schools have their own page with even more information about them that a user has access to. Furthermore, users can sign up to save schools they are interested and have the ability to edit their own posts, reply to other posts or delete their own posts.
